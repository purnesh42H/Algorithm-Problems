Python programs for several algorithm problems

1) Algorithms and data structure problems written by me in python 2.72.

2) Most of the coding problems are started with clarifying assumptions, examples, trade-offs, advantages prior to actual code. 

3) Some problem has been written with various approaches.

4) Good to practice for coding interviews.

5) Runs with python 2x.
